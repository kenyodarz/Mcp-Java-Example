- expected configuration classes to review:

## 12. Acceptance criteria

- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] 
- [ ] The initiative defines which scaffold placeholders will be replaced and which will not.
- [ ] The initiative makes the MCP baseline state and placeholder scope explicit before
  implementation.
- [ ] The initiative defines the minimum cross-cutting controls required for the slice.
- [ ] The initiative identifies expected wiring and critical configuration impact.

## 13. Validation strategy

- unit tests:
- integration tests:
- contract tests:
- manual validation:

### Expected slice closure evidence

- code path aligned with the spec
- critical configuration aligned with the spec
- placeholder replacement or isolation aligned with the spec
- traceability and checklist updated

## 14. Risks and open questions
